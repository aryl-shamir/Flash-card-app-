# 🧠 Flash Card App for Learning English

This is a simple **Flash Card App** built using Python and Tkinter. It helps users (especially kids or beginners) to improve their English vocabulary by translating French words into English. This project was made with love for my junior brother to make language learning interactive and fun ❤️.

## 📝 Note:

At the start of the program, the `score_data.txt` and `words_to_learn.csv` files do **not** exist.  
These files are automatically created **only after** you start interacting with the app.

- When you click the ✅ **right button** ("I know this word"), that word is removed from the active word list.
- The updated list is then saved to `words_to_learn.csv`, so the app remembers which words you still need to learn.
- Your score is also saved and updated in `score_data.txt`.

This ensures that each session picks up right where you left off.

## 🧒 Why I Built This

I created this app to help my little brother build his English vocabulary in a more visual and interactive way. Instead of using paper flashcards, this app makes the learning process digital and fun!, and whenever i see a score of more than 60, he obtain a bottle of juice.
